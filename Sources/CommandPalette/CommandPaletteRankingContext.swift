/// scorer evaluates *word-boundary-aware* signals — the class of match that
/// makes VS Code, Sublime, and Raycast pickers "feel" right: characters that
/// land at the start of a word (after a separator) count for more, runs of
/// consecutive characters are rewarded, and matches smeared across large gaps
/// are penalized.
///
/// It carries the inputs (`tokenChars`, `candidateChars`, `segments`) plus an
/// optional `frecency` bonus, and produces a ``Features`` bag describing the
/// best left-to-right subsequence alignment. New ranking signals can be added
/// to ``Features`` and consumed in ``score()`` without threading new arguments
/// through every call site, so growing the ranking model stays mechanical.
///
/// The score it returns is deliberately a *fallback tier*: it sits below the
/// scorer's exact, prefix, whole-word, and substring ladders so that a
/// boundary-aware fuzzy match never outranks a clean textual match.
